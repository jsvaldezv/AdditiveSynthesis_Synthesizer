## ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS SYNTHESIZER

### By: Jesús Salvador Valdez Vázquez

In this plug-in an additive synthesis synthesizer was developed which works with two oscillators with which you can change the type of wave from sine to square, triangular or saw. It also has two LFOs which work in a sinusoidal way, the LFO modulates the signal from 0 to 10 Hz. Added a power button for the LFO and a basic interface design. 

**Work with MIDI in any DAW.**
